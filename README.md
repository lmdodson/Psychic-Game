Word Guess Game

This game is a holiday take on the classic 'letter guess' style game. Simple press a letter on the keyboard to take a guess. Guess incorrectly too many times and you lose! This front-end game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Check out the live version of the game here: https://lmdodson.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/
